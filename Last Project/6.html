		In 15th-century France, the evil archdeacon of Notre Dame is Claude Frollo (Sir Cedric Hardwicke). Under his command is a deformed hunchback, Quasimodo (Charles Laughton), who is instructed to capture the Gypsy Esmeralda (Maureen O'Hara), the object of Frollo's unrequited lust. Phoebus (Alan Marshal), the man Esmeralda loves, rescues her Phoebus (Alan Marshal), but she is framed for his murder, setting the stage for a gripping confrontation between Frollo and Quasimodo.
