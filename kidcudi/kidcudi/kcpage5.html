	<p>“I was in San Diego at a memorial, visiting my boy Q, who founded WorldStarHipHop, and I got a text. Cudi’s manager hit me up. Three or four text exchanges go back and forth, then Cudi calls me. I was inside this Japanese bargain store, killing time. I was like, ‘Cudi, what’s good?’ He goes, ‘I got this idea. My birthday’s coming up. How fast can you make a chain?’ I was like, ‘What made you hit me up?’ He was like, ‘You know what? I’ve never had a custom chain before.’ I was like, ‘What? You had a Jacob [the Jeweler] Jesus piece.’ He was like, ‘Yeah, ’Ye gave me that. I started going back and forth with Pharrell, and Pharrell was like, ‘You gotta fuck with Ben Baller.’’ </p>
	<p>“So we started bouncing ideas off of each other. He was texting me pictures and sent me a drawing that Murakami did of him, ’cause Murakami did Kids See Ghosts. I looked at it and was like, ‘This is cool, but this ain’t gonna translate into jewelry.’ He sends me another picture, an old picture of a Bape Milo character [of him] that NIGO® designed from 2009-2010. He was like, ‘You know I used to work at the Bape [SoHo] store?’ I thought he was joking. I looked at the picture and was like, ‘This is it. I’m gonna put white diamonds here, blue sapphires here…’ I was breaking down everything, and then he goes, ‘Yo, I need you to do me a favor. I need you to change the eyeballs. I don’t want black eyeballs. I want two red ruby eyeballs, and I want the entire thing to be one stone.’ I was like, ‘You sure?’ He goes, ‘Yeah, I’m the stoner. I’m the kid rager.’</p>

	<p>“Later, I asked what he wanted on the back of [the chain]. He was like, ‘I want that shit to say General Cud, and I want my Cudi logo.’ We get this going and I’m like, ‘Bro, where are we meeting?’ He was like, ‘I’m at the studio. You need to pull up right now.’ I get to the studio and this dude’s smiling ear to ear. I pull out the chain and everyone in the room was like, ‘Holy shit.’ Cudi’s bugging out and goes, ‘I gotta leave the room. I gotta FaceTime my daughter and show her this chain.’ He was in there for, like, 15 to 20 minutes. I think he called me twice after I left the studio. I think the motherfucker slept with the chain on.”</p>
