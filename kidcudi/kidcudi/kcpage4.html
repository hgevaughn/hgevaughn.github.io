	<p>“Cudi, on one hand, represents the freedom to be into many things and have a really serious, informed opinion about those things to take what he likes in terms of inspiration and be able to turn it into a solid thought or concept. That’s who he is as a person. On the other hand, he also marches to the beat of his own drum. </p>

	<p>“His confidence is not in how good he is. His confidence is how authentic his conviction is. You know, what he thinks is fundamentally wrong is wrong, and what he thinks is fundamentally right is right. And whether you agree with him or not, you can tell he believes that, and his belief in his convictions and his consistency in his convictions gives him the taste that he has, but it also is what his fans love about him so much.</p>
	<p>“When they say Cudi is the GOAT, they’re talking about the consistency of his convictions and how that’s played out into the choices that he makes, the taste that he has, and the tone that he takes with everything that he does. That’s my idea of Cudi.”</p>
