	<p>Hall spoke about Kanye West being just one of many artists who credit Cudi for influencing their sound. “Kanye is well documented in saying things like, ‘Yo, Cudi is someone that helped make me. He’s one of the people that helped to cultivate my sound,’” said Hall. “There’s a lot of people that really got a sound from Cudi, and even still to this day, you can hear the Cudi influence on certain records.”</p>
	<p>Morel also pointed to Cudi’s impact on Kanye’s 808s & Heartbreak, which inspired a whole generation of rappers to share their emotions. “None of this happens without ‘808s & Heartbreak,’” he explained. “It was the first time that a whole record of someone else going through something was a major hip-hop hit, and a major mainstream hit. That record sold so many records, and all of these other things that came out of it like ‘So Far Gone.’”</p>
	<p>“When I first heard Cudi, his voice, his melody, his subject matter, and the combination of him putting the melody with the rap in a way that I hadn’t really heard since Bone Thugs felt really new. When I heard his mixtape, I said I wanted to write with him. </p>
	<p>“I remember working on 808s & Heartbreak and he was sitting in the front area in the Hawaii studio. I was on the laptop, and he was like, ‘OK, this is what I got... In the night I hear them talk.’ It went somewhere else and, of course, I put the pop—‘the coldest story ever told,’ which [came] from me listening to country music and Coldplay. How that happened is how we’ve written music together over the years.”</p>
